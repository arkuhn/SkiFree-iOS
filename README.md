# SkiFree-iOS

This is a port of one of my first childhood games, SkiFree. I played it on my parent's computer a *long* time ago.
Now I'm porting it to iOS to learn Swift and Spritekit development. 

## Getting Started

Currently, I'm manually deploying this app to an iPhone 7 via XCode. I have no long term plans to release this to the app store,
and all in-app formatting is tailored for the iPhone 7. Cross-device support/scaling might be added down the road. 


## Built With

* [XCode 8.1]
* [Spritekit]
* [iOS 10.1]

## TODO
* Add the yeti!
* Prevent obstacle overlapping
* Highscore mechanism
